# objective 
The main objectives of WSNs in water quality monitoring systems are to carry real and reliable information from the water environment to remote data monitoring nodes via the LoRa network and end users can access data via mobile phone or personal computer. Identification of suitable algorithms and protocol WSNs for water quality monitoring is a challenge due to the limitation of energy, computation capability, and storage resources of the sensor nodes
